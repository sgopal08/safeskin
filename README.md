# SafeSkin

A product ingredient scanner app.

SafeSkin allows users to quickly identify ingredients in skincare, makeup, and other beauty or hygiene products that may trigger allergies or require caution. Users can input ingredients they are allergic to or want to avoid, and the app will scan and highlight those ingredients from hard-to-read product labels.

Built using Apple VisionKit's VNDocumentCameraViewController.
